**Agileplanner for eConference** is a patched version of [AgilePlanner](http://ase.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/ase/index.php/AgilePlanning/AgilePlanner), a card-Based planning tool for co-located & distributed agile teams.

It's an [eConference](http://code.google.com/p/econference4/) plug-in; it shows a ballot dialogue, which lets a user choose whether to use the editor as a local standalone application, or regularly, as shared editor. In the first case, only the local file name is to be chosen and no details about server configs are prompted.

**Agileplanner for eConference** is best used together with [eConference3P (PlanningPoker Plugin)](http://code.google.com/p/econference-planning-poker-plugin/), in order to visually edit user stories to be estimated.
